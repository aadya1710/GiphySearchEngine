**Project Name :** Giphy Search Engine

**Contributor:** Aadya Mittal

**About the project:**<br />
The project I chose for the Uaceit Winter Mentorship Program 2.0 was Giphy Search Engine. Giphy Search Engine is a website where you can look for GIFs that you like.
On this website, you can find and share the best Search Engine GIFs and most popular animated GIFs.

**Project Repo:**<br />
Check out the code on my website via this repo link: aadya1710/GiphySearchEngine (github.com)

**Technical Stacks used:**<br />
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and APIs are the most commonly used technical stacks.

**Week-wise progress in this mentorship program:**<br />
This was how my journey for the entire programme goes:
In the first week I learned how to use github and git bash through the resources provided by the mentor . We began working on the project the following week, and I created the search engine's basic framework.I started by creating the search engine and sign-in page in HTML, then added CSS, before moving on to the website's main page.Then I worked on the main page by adding different types of HTML,CSS tags. Then I added a favicon and background to the text(Giphy Search Engine). After that, we were given API and javascript resources to use in the project the following week.  Finally, after fully integrating the website, I pushed all of the code to my github repo and generated a link for my website.

**Conclusion:**<br />
I was able to construct a fantastic website thanks to the Uaceit mentorship programme. During the training, I learned some new tech stacks that will come in handy for future projects.

**Future Scope:**<br />
In the future I can add a backend to my website where it can keep track of people coming to my website. Since GIFs are something used in the daily conversation of people, the website will be more visited by the people.  Because machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) are becoming more powerful than previously, I can now include some of its features, such as chatbots and voice search integration.
